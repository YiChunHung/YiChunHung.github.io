He received his B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, in 2019. Mr. Hung has conducted multiple interdisciplinary projects including non-destructive imaging, remote sensing and deep learning. The outcomes of his research were published into several international proceeding conference papers. Additionally, several patents and top-tier peer-reviewed journals are preparing on these research topics. He has also receive several international awards and scholarships including  PyTorch Scholarship Challenge from Facebook (2018), National Science Council Research Scholarship, Taiwan (2018) and IEEE Arctic Chanllenge Sponsership (2018, only 6 winners over the world). On the other hand, he is also an action-oriented educator to inspire his juniors to realize the creative ideas. To this end, he launched a semester-long cultivating program in 2017 to encourage juniors for the original and innovative projects. The program benefited over 50 juniors and been officially supported by the department. The program have kept running by juniors over 3 years."
